# Learn with Dr. G

Welcome to Learn with Dr. G! My name is Sarah and my goal is to create approachable first steps into coding and software engineering. 

## What is This?

There is a lot you will find in this repo, including:
- Resources from talks
- Sample projects with guides
- Links to resources that I've found helpful along my coding journey
- A blog
- A community

## A community? Really?

While this repo was mostly a place to me to put down things I found interesting that I thought you might also find interesting, I also want it to be a collaborative place!

If you have a sample project that you want to share, let me know! I'd love to highlight it in a blog, or try it out myself and add some guides around it as I learn it too :) (Don't worry, I will of course credit you and link to your original work!)

If you have a question about something, open up an issue! I'd love to chat about it with you! And while you're there, check out some of the questions other folks have asked, maybe you have a better answer than me!

Did you attend one of my talks? SHAWEET - that means there is probably a table for it somewhere in here where you can try forking, cloning, branching, commiting, pushing, PRing, and contributing!
